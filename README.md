# PsyMind.AI

PsyMind.AI is an educational emotional support solution designed to help high school students understand their behaviors and emotions through scientific psychology.

## Introduction

PsyMind.AI interprets student reports and, empathetically, explains possible psychological causes while offering practical improvement guidelines. The proposal seeks to reduce anxiety, procrastination, and self-sabotage, strengthening mental health and school performance.

Developed with **NotebookLM** and **Gemini Gems**, the system relies on studies regarding motivation, focus, and well-being, ensuring theoretical grounding.

The tool includes ethical alerts encouraging the search for professional help and integrates a future module to refer students to volunteer partner psychologists or free services, making the project safe, accessible, and socially responsible.
